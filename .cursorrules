# Product Team's Tool Chest

This project transforms AI assistants into product development partners, guiding users from idea to interactive prototype.

## Automatic Workflow

When the user describes a product idea or asks to start product development, follow the workflow in `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md`.

**Workflow phases:**
1. **Market Research** - Use web search to find competitors, market sizing, customer pain points
2. **AI Framing** (optional) - For AI/ML products only
3. **PRFAQ** - Amazon-style Working Backwards documentation
4. **PRD** - Detailed requirements with EARS syntax
5. **Prototype** - Interactive HTML with modular screens

**Key rules:**
- All outputs are **HTML files** saved to `./documents/`
- Use file naming: `[Type]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html`
- Follow design standards in `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md` (avoid AI slop)
- Tech stack: AWS-native (Amazon Bedrock for generative AI, AWS services for infrastructure)
- **Prototype screens must link together** - every button/link navigates to the correct screen
- **For known companies:** Fetch and use their actual logo, brand colors, and typography

**Brand assets (for known companies):**
When building for a recognizable company (Amazon, Google, Acme Corp, etc.):
1. **Search for their logo** - press kit, media page, official CDN
2. **Extract brand colors** - exact hex values from their website
3. **Identify typography** - their fonts or closest Google Fonts match
4. **Apply to all outputs** - Design System uses their colors, prototypes show their logo in header/footer

**To start:**
1. Ask the user about their product idea
2. After gathering info, tell them: "I'll pause after each phase for your feedback. Say 'switch to streamlined' anytime if you'd prefer I work through everything continuously."

**Workflow mode (default: Full Approval):**
- Pause after each phase for feedback and approval before continuing
- User can say "switch to streamlined" to work through phases continuously
- User can switch back anytime with "switch to full approval"

## Phase Guides

Load these as needed during each phase:
- `prompts/Market Research Agent.md`
- `prompts/AI Framing Agent.md` (AI/ML products only)
- `prompts/PRFAQ Guide.md`
- `prompts/PRD Creation Guide.md`
- `prompts/Prototype Creation Guide.md`

## Design Standards

Avoid generic "AI slop":
- No Inter, Roboto, Arial fonts
- No purple-to-blue gradients
- No uniform card grids
- Use distinctive typography matching product aesthetic
- Apply 60-30-10 color rule
- Add visual texture and depth

## Sample Outputs
