# Product Team's Tool Chest

This project transforms AI assistants into product development partners, guiding users from idea to interactive prototype.

## Automatic Workflow

When the user describes a product idea or asks to start product development, follow the workflow in `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md`.

**Workflow phases:**
1. **Market Research** - Use web search to find competitors, market sizing, customer pain points
2. **AI Framing** (optional) - For AI/ML products only
3. **PRFAQ** - Amazon-style Working Backwards documentation
4. **PRD** - Detailed requirements with EARS syntax
5. **Prototype** - Interactive HTML with modular screens

**Key rules:**
- All outputs are **HTML files** saved to `./documents/`
- Use file naming: `[Type]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html`
- Follow design standards in `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md` (avoid AI slop)
- Tech stack: AWS-native (Amazon Bedrock for generative AI, AWS services for infrastructure)
- **Prototype screens must link together** - every button/link navigates to the correct screen
- **For known companies:** Fetch and use their actual logo, brand colors, and typography

**Brand assets (REQUIRED for known companies):**
When building for a recognizable company (Discovery Education, Amazon, Google, etc.):

1. **SEARCH for their logo NOW** - do not skip this step:
   - Search: "[Company Name] logo png", "[Company Name] press kit", "[Company Name] Wikipedia"
   - Check: company press page, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, Brandfetch.com

2. **VERIFY the logo URL works using curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -sI "[LOGO_URL]" | head -5
   ```
   - Check for `HTTP/2 200` or `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
   - **If it shows 404/403/error, TRY ANOTHER URL**
   - Keep trying until you find a working URL (200 OK)
   - Do NOT use a URL you haven't verified with curl

3. **Extract brand colors** - visit their website, use dev tools to get exact hex values

4. **Identify typography** - their fonts or closest Google Fonts match

5. **Embed VERIFIED logo in outputs:**
   - Market Research: `<img src="[VERIFIED-URL]">` in "Brand Assets" section
   - Design System: Use their colors as CSS variables
   - Prototypes: Show logo in header, login screens, footer

**Logo verification loop:** Try URL → fetch fails? → try next URL → repeat until success

## Prototype Structure

**Create MODULAR files, not a single monolithic HTML:**
- `DesignSystem_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` - Shared CSS (create FIRST)
- `Screen_[Name]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` - One file per screen
- `ScreenIndex_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` - Navigation hub (use template at `prompts/ScreenIndex_Template.html`)

**ScreenIndex placeholders to replace:**
`[PRODUCT_NAME]`, `[PRODUCT_SLUG]`, `[CUSTOMER_LOGO]`, `[BRAND_PRIMARY]`, `[BRAND_SECONDARY]`, `[BRAND_ACCENT]`, `[DATE]`, `[PROGRESS_PERCENT]`, `[SCREEN_COUNT]`, `[SCREEN_CARDS]`

**Fully interactive prototypes (REQUIRED):**
- All buttons/links navigate to correct screens
- Chat interfaces: typing indicator + simulated responses after 1-2s delay
- Forms: validation, loading states, success/error feedback
- Dropdowns/selects: open, select, close
- Modals: open on trigger, close on X/backdrop/Escape
- Data tables: sort, filter, paginate

**To start:**
1. Ask the user about their product idea
2. After gathering info, tell them: "I'll pause after each phase for your feedback. Say 'switch to streamlined' anytime if you'd prefer I work through everything continuously."

**Workflow mode (default: Full Approval):**
- Pause after each phase for feedback and approval before continuing
- User can say "switch to streamlined" to work through phases continuously
- User can switch back anytime with "switch to full approval"

## Phase Guides

Load these as needed during each phase:
- `prompts/Market Research Agent.md`
- `prompts/AI Framing Agent.md` (AI/ML products only)
- `prompts/PRFAQ Guide.md`
- `prompts/PRD Creation Guide.md`
- `prompts/Prototype Creation Guide.md`

## Design Standards

Avoid generic "AI slop":
- No Inter, Roboto, Arial fonts
- No purple-to-blue gradients
- No uniform card grids
- Use distinctive typography matching product aesthetic
- Apply 60-30-10 color rule
- Add visual texture and depth
