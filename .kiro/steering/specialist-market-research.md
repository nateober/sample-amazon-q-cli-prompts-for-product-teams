2. **Cite sources** for all market sizing figures
3. **Find specific quotes** from customer reviews showing pain points
4. **Get actual pricing** from competitor websites
5. **Fetch brand assets** if building for a known company (see below)

## Customer Brand Assets (REQUIRED for known companies)

**If building for a known company, you MUST fetch their actual brand assets. This is not optional.**

### Step-by-Step Logo Fetching (DO THIS FIRST)

1. **Perform a web search** for the company's logo:
   - "[Company Name] logo png"
   - "[Company Name] press kit"
   - "[Company Name] brand guidelines"
   - "site:[company-domain] logo"
   - "[Company Name] Wikipedia" (check infobox image)

2. **Check these sources in order:**
   - Official press/media/newsroom page (e.g., `company.com/press`)
   - Wikipedia article (usually has high-quality official logos)
   - LinkedIn company page (banner/logo)
   - Brandfetch.com, Clearbit, or similar brand databases

3. **Get the actual image URL:**
   - Find the logo image on the page
   - Get the direct URL to the image file (should end in .png, .svg, .jpg)

4. **VERIFY the URL works using curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -sI "[LOGO_URL]" | head -5
   ```
   - Check for `HTTP/2 200` or `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
   - If the response shows 404, 403, or error → **go back and try another URL**
   - Keep trying URLs until one returns 200 OK
   - Do NOT proceed with a URL you haven't verified

5. **Logo verification loop:**
   ```
   WHILE logo not verified:
     1. Get a logo URL from search results
     2. Run: curl -sI "[URL]" | head -5
     3. IF response shows 200 OK → verified! Use this URL
     4. IF response shows 404/403/error → try next URL
     5. IF all URLs fail → search with different query
   ```

6. **Include VERIFIED logo in your research document:**
   ```html
   <section class="brand-assets">
     <h2>Brand Assets</h2>
     <img src="[VERIFIED-LOGO-URL]" alt="Company Logo" style="max-height: 60px;">
     <p><strong>Logo URL:</strong> [VERIFIED-LOGO-URL]</p>
     <p><strong>Verified:</strong> Yes - successfully fetched</p>
   </section>
   ```

### Brand Colors (REQUIRED)
- Visit the company's website
- Use browser dev tools (Inspect Element) to find exact hex values
- Document: `Primary: #007DC3 (Blue)`, `Secondary: #6DC067 (Green)`

### Typography
- Identify fonts from their website's CSS
- Suggest Google Fonts alternatives if they use custom fonts

### Example: Discovery Education
```html
<section class="brand-assets">
  <h2>Brand Assets - Discovery Education</h2>
  <img src="https://www.discoveryeducation.com/wp-content/themes/theme starter theme/images/de-logo.svg" alt="Discovery Education Logo" style="max-height: 60px;">
  <p><strong>Logo URL:</strong> https://www.discoveryeducation.com/wp-content/themes/starter-theme/images/de-logo.svg</p>
  <p><strong>Primary Color:</strong> #007DC3 (Discovery Blue)</p>
  <p><strong>Secondary Color:</strong> #6DC067 (Green)</p>
  <p><strong>Typography:</strong> Proxima Nova (use 'Montserrat' or 'Open Sans' as fallback)</p>
</section>
```

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed to PRFAQ without a real logo URL in the Brand Assets section.

## Output Requirements

Deliver findings in a well-structured HTML document:
- TAM/SAM/SOM with dollar figures AND sources
- At least 3-5 competitors with real pricing data
- Customer pain points with specific examples (not generic)
- No placeholder text (TBD, TODO, [insert])
- **Brand Assets section with actual logo URL and colors** (for known companies)
